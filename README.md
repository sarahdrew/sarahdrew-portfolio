# FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPER PORTFOLIO

Hi I'm Sarah Drew. Through my time at Thinkful, I have learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, React, Git, Node, Express, SQL, postgreSQL, and a variety of testing languages.

### Where Should I Move?

An app created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the Weatherbit API, JQuery for people who know they want to move to a new city, but don't know where. If the live weather of a chosen city matches their preference, they're able to click a button and be directed to a search for one way tickets to their future home.
